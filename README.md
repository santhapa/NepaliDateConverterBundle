# Introduction
This repository is Synfony Bundle that can be used to convert English date to Nepali and Nepali to English with the Symfony applications(most probably).

This bundle is the restructuring of the Nepali Date Convert at https://github.com/amant/Nepali-Date-Convert/blob/master/php/nepali_calendar.php by Aman Tuladhar. All the logic credits goes to him.

Somehow, I have tried to add few features such as output the results with predefined format. You can also format the result yourself from the array values like in the original code by Aman Tuladhar.

I have also refered https://github.com/FiveDotsSoft/Nepali-Date-Converter while creating this bundle.
